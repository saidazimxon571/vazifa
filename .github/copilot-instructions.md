# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This is a minimal Python project located in `python/dars/`. The main file is `dars1.py`.

## Structure
- `python/dars/dars1.py`: Main script. Contains variable assignments and a string formatting example.

## Key Patterns
- Uses basic Python variable assignments and f-string formatting.
- No external dependencies or complex architecture.
- No build, test, or debug scripts are present.

## Conventions
- All code is currently in a single file.
- Variable names are in lowercase and use simple, descriptive names.
- F-strings are used for string interpolation.

## Developer Workflow
- Edit and run `python/dars/dars1.py` directly with Python 3.
  - Example: `python3 python/dars/dars1.py`
- No special setup, build, or test commands are required.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- Focus on simple, direct Python scripting.
- If expanding, keep new scripts in `python/dars/` unless otherwise specified.
- Follow the variable naming and formatting style found in `dars1.py`.
- Document any new conventions in this file if the project grows.

## Example
```python
adres = "mu"
masao = "4"
pul = "yoq"
jami = f"{adres} yol {masao} pul"
```
